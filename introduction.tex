\section{Motivation}

- intro two qubit gate: 
	- Role in algorithm; clifford group (?)  --> just subset is enough for computation, implies decomposition of more complex gates. 
	- In NISQ, this can be a problem due to decoherence
- in specific cases, might be useful to have something else than two standard clifford group to make it gate/time efficient. 
- in this work, investigate one case applied to Variation Quantum Algorithms. Other recent example iswap.
In the \gls{nisq} era, the performance of quantum devices is severely limited by noise. One major consequence of noise for superconducting qubits is decoherence. For a fixed coherence time, only a finite number of operations can be performed before all the quantum information is leaked to the environment. Operations in a quantum circuit are called quantum gates. 

\glspl{vqa} are a class of algorithms which use small variations in a function to find the minimum or maximum of that function. They are typically more robust to noise
